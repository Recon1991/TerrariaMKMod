		Project Readme
---------------------------------------------
Aloha! and Welcome to the Git repository for the Terraria TKM Project.

This is a simple README file which will include some of the project guidelines that this mod will follow.

First and foremost, we are not modding this for resale and create revenue from. This project is primarily for fun and adding some content to the game Terraria.

Second, The code that we are working with is using an engine called tConfig.  You will need tConfig to work on this project.  Visit http://tconfig.wikia.com/wiki/TConfig_Wiki
for more info

Third, When modifying/editing the project, please make sure you comment on what you are doing as it helps when other developers access the project.

Thats all for the guidelines, have fun and mod Terraria!

NOTE: It would be nice to re-label the code since most of it doesn't make any sense. It may take awhile but it will be very benificial to us all in the future.
